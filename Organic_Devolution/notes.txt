I don't know what crazy freak designed this game, but it's awesome.
It's has the basic commands you would expect, and lists them in the man command
but it also has a bunch of other commands that are just plain weird, and aren't listed as official commands.
I'm not sure what they do, but I'm going to try them out.
So far I've tried:
```
$ harvest
$ appropriate
$ blaspheme
```


there are probably more, but I haven't found them yet.

I will update this file as I find more commands.
